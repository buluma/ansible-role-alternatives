## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-alternatives/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: true

  roles:
    - role: buluma.alternatives
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-alternatives/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: false

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap

  tasks:
    - name: make a fake binary
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /bin/my_fake_binary
        state: touch
        mode: "0755"
```

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in [`defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-alternatives/blob/master/defaults/main.yml):

# python 2.7 and python 3.7.
# alternatives_list:
